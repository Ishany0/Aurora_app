## 🌪️ The Problem

Students and early-career professionals regularly face intense cognitive overload, emotional exhaustion, and burnout. Generic conversational AI chatbots often encourage endless, circular discussions that increase fatigue, while standard productivity software transforms personal vulnerabilities into daunting task backlogs. Furthermore, existing journaling tools frequently route private thoughts to central analytics pools without cryptographic or path-level owner isolation, making users hesitant to express their authentic feelings.

---

## 💡 The Solution

**Aurora** is a private, multimodal reflection workspace that transforms unvarnished personal thoughts into grounded emotional clarity and **exactly one practical next step**. Users express themselves through text, voice dictation, or photo uploads. Rather than running an unconstrained chatbot, Aurora orchestrates four distinct, single-purpose Gemini API agents (Mood & Signal, Reflection, Action, and Pattern Digest) to safely process thoughts while keeping all data isolated strictly inside owner-bound Google Cloud Firestore subcollections.

---

## ✨ What Makes Aurora Different

- 🎯 **One Manageable Step (Anti-Overwhelm)**: Rejects bloated to-do backlogs; generates exactly one realistic, low-effort next action (with time estimate) that can be accepted, edited, dismissed, or exported directly to your calendar (`.ics` / Google Calendar).
- 🔒 **Fail-Safe "Save-Before-AI" Storage**: Raw reflections are guaranteed and committed to Cloud Firestore *before* triggering any Gemini API call, ensuring zero lost thoughts even during network or API interruptions.
- 🔍 **Explainability Panels ("Why am I seeing this?")**: Every insight transparently cites supporting entry counts, date ranges, and confidence levels without leaking internal model reasoning traces.
- 🧠 **Calibrated Mood Memory**: Users can override AI-detected mood tags; Aurora remembers recent calibrations per user and uses them as few-shot prompt context without cross-user data contamination.
- 🛡️ **Zero Cross-Tenant Leakage**: Enforces strict Firestore security rules (`/users/{uid}/...`) with automated unit tests, immediate in-memory state wiping on sign-out, and instant one-click data export / deletion.
- 🎙️ **Private Multimodal Inputs**: Complete support for voice dictation (Web Speech API) and photo reflections (Firebase Storage), with coarse location privacy rounding (~1.1 km).

## 🚀 Features Beyond the Base App

- **Structured Multi-Agent Pipeline**: Decouples mood signal extraction, empathetic reflection, and action planning across isolated, purpose-built Gemini prompts.
- **Weekly Pattern Digest with Evidence Counts**: Synthesizes recurring triggers and emotional trends across approved entries with exact date ranges and frequency counts (skips analysis if <5 entries).
- **Explainability Panel**: Every insight includes a transparent breakdown of supporting entries, topic clusters, and confidence levels without exposing raw chain-of-thought traces.
- **Continuous Voice Reflection**: Built-in speech-to-text dictation via Web Speech API with real-time feedback and browser capability detection.
- **Privacy-Preserving Geolocation**: Coarse rounding (~1.1 km) before reverse geocoding to prevent pinpoint coordinate leakage.
- **Comprehensive User Sovereignty**: Direct tag corrections (stored as few-shot user preferences), per-entry pattern exclusions, full JSON/Markdown data export, and complete account erasure.

## 🎙️ Voice Input (Web Speech API) & Resilient Fallbacks

Aurora includes client-side speech dictation designed for optional zero-pressure reflection:

- **Browser Capability Detection**: Uses standard `window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition`. If unsupported, the voice control displays `Voice unavailable in this browser` and disables gracefully without blocking typed input.
- **Direct User Gesture Execution**: Starts recognition strictly on direct button click/tap handlers, preserving browser user-activation tokens and avoiding asynchronous interruption.
- **Lifecycle & Memory Management**: Holds a single `SpeechRecognition` instance per mount in React `useRef`, releasing all listeners and aborting active sessions on component unmount, sign-out, or account switching.
- **Configuration**: Configured with `continuous = false`, `interimResults = true`, `maxAlternatives = 1`, and `lang = "en-IN"` (defaulting to browser language).
- **Interim Transcription Streaming**: Streams live interim transcript words into an animated listening banner below the editor and appends final recognized sentences to existing typed drafts with a single space (never overwriting user drafts).
- **Graceful Error Mapping & Recovery Panel**:
  - `not-allowed` / `permission-denied` / `service-not-allowed` → Displays `Microphone permission blocked` with an expandable step-by-step guidance panel to enable mic access.
  - `network` → Displays `Speech service unavailable` with a troubleshooting guide (direct HTTPS Cloud Run URL, Chrome recommendations, VPN/proxy check, and fallback to keyboard typing) along with a clean "Try again" reset button.
  - `no-speech` → Displays `No speech detected. Please try again.`
  - `audio-capture` → Displays `No microphone was found. Check your microphone connection.`
  - `aborted` → Resets quietly to `idle`.
- **Zero Impact on Core Functionality**: Voice dictation is completely optional. If voice fails or is unavailable, manual keyboard input, photo attachment, location tagging, durable Firestore saving, and Gemini reflections remain 100% operational.
- **Network & Privacy Isolation**: Audio is processed exclusively by the browser's native speech recognition engine. Raw audio streams are never transmitted to backend servers or the Gemini API.

---

## 🛡 Reliability & Safety

- 💾 **Save-Before-AI Guarantee**: User entries are saved to durable Firestore storage prior to invoking Gemini. If an API outage occurs, the entry remains saved with an `analysisStatus: "unavailable"` label.
- 🪜 **Automated Fallback Ladder**: Backend API calls cascade across prioritized models (`gemini-3.7-flash` → `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` → `gemini-flash-latest`) upon recoverable HTTP/API status errors (`503`, `429`, `500`).
- 📋 **Schema Validation & Defensive Parsing**: All structured Gemini outputs are validated against strict TypeScript/JSON schemas, with single-retry repair routines for malformed payloads.
- 🛑 **Duplicate Prevention & Idempotency**: Submission controls assign unique client idempotency keys and disable interactive buttons during execution to avoid accidental double-posts.
- 🩺 **Non-Clinical Stance & Crisis Safety**: If acute distress is detected (`concern_flag: true`), Aurora suppresses productivity tasks, displays regional support hotlines, and excludes the entry from digests and webhooks.

---

## Security and secrets

- Gemini and other server-only API keys are stored in Google Secret Manager and injected
  into Cloud Run only at runtime.
- No server-only secrets are included in frontend code, browser bundles, or this repository.
- Firebase web configuration is public client configuration; Firestore and Storage access is
  enforced with owner-isolation security rules.
- `.env` files are excluded from version control. Use `.env.example` for local setup.
- If a credential is ever exposed, it must be revoked/rotated immediately.

### Firestore Security Rules Baseline

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, create, update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;

      match /{subcollection}/{docId} {
        allow read, create, update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 👀 How a Judge Can Verify This Project

In under 5 minutes, a judge can verify Aurora's core capabilities:

1. **Verify Live Auth & Reflection Flow**: Open the [Live Cloud Run URL](https://ais-dev-wuo2gdbdhq7aa4ie75xoms-874611223113.asia-southeast1.run.app), sign in with Google, and create an entry using voice or text.
2. **Confirm Multi-Agent & Calendar Output**: Check the structured mood tag, the streaming empathetic reflection, the suggested action item, and test the calendar export (`.ics` / Google Calendar).
3. **Inspect Firestore Security Rules**: Review `firestore.rules` to confirm strict `/users/{userId}/...` path matching.
4. **Execute Rules Unit Tests**: Run local automated tests using the Firebase Emulator:
   ```bash
   firebase emulators:exec --only firestore "node --test firestore.rules.test.js"
   ```
5. **Verify Cross-User Isolation**: Sign out, sign in with a different Google account, and verify that the first account's entries and settings are completely invisible.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Probabilistic Insights**: Mood classification and confidence scores represent natural language pattern detection, not clinical or diagnostic assessments.
- **Browser Speech Support**: Voice dictation relies on Web Speech API implementations, which vary across browser engines (e.g., Chrome vs. Firefox).
- **Coarse Location Precision**: Geocoding deliberately rounds coordinates (~1.1 km) to safeguard exact physical locations.
- **Minimum Data for Digests**: Pattern synthesis requires at least 5 approved entries; Aurora will not force speculative conclusions on sparse data.
- **Introspective Scope**: Aurora is designed as a personal reflection tool, not a clinical treatment system or emergency crisis line.

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- 🔑 **Client-Side Zero-Knowledge Encryption**: Optional passphrase-derived client-side encryption of raw journal entries prior to Firestore sync.
- 📱 **Offline Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Full service worker offline caching allowing offline drafting with automatic sync upon reconnection.
- 🔄 **Two-Way Calendar Sync**: Bi-directional status synchronization to update Aurora actions when completed in Google Calendar.
- ⌚ **Local Wearable Correlation**: Optional, on-device correlation of reflection mood trends against sleep and activity metrics.
